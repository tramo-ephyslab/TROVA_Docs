TROVA: TRansport Of water VApor
=================================
TRansport Of water VApor (TROVA) is a software developed in Python and Fortran
for the study of moisture sources and sinks. It has been developed within the LAGRIMA and 
SETESTRELO projects at the EPhysLab (Environmental Physics Laboratory) at the University of Vigo. 
Subsequently, its development and updating have continued within a collaboration between the University 
of Vigo and the Galician Supercomputing Center. Many investigations use this software to obtain scientific results.

TROVA Software architecture

TROVA allows the use of the FLEXible PARTicle global dispersion model and the FLEXPART-WRF 
regional model at different spatial resolutions. It also includes the methodologies 
of Stohl and James (2005) and Sodemann et al. (2008). We herein refer to these methodologies
as STHOL2005 and SOD2008 respectively. It contains two main modules:

1- Developed in Python that is responsible for reading the files, configuring TROVA,
and generating the outputs of the moisture budget *(Evaporation (E)-Precipitation (P))* 
for the number of days selected in the simulations.

2- Developed in Fortran that is used in interface with Python so that the calculations 
of great computational demand are carried out in the shortest possible time. It also 
includes a parallel implementation using the MPI library to reduce TROVA processing time.

3- This new version includes the analysis of moisture sources and sinks by vertical layers.

For a more detailed understanding of TROVA, Figure 1 presents a flowchart where the general 
algorithm of the software is explained. The first step that must be carried out corresponds 
to the configuration of the input file where the run parameters are established. The second 
is to run the model forward or backward in time to determine moisture sources and sinks. The 
tracking mode is defined in the input file. The third step corresponds to TROVA where it reads 
the necessary files for tracking the particles, then performs the calculations of the changes 
in humidity of the particles using the functions developed in Fortran. These will allow greater
computational efficiency and decrease the run time. The fourth step is calculating the E-P field 
on the output mesh defined by the user from the Stohl and James (2005) equation. Finally, TROVA 
saves the output in the user-defined format, which can be NetCDF, ASCII, or any.

TROVA software functionalities  
--------------------------------

TROVA allows the study of moisture sources and sinks based on the calculation of the E-P fields, 
using the main methodologies of Stohl and James (2005) and Sodemann et al. [2008]. In addition, TROVA 
provides the advantage of using different numerical outputs from FLEXPART and FLEXPART-WRF at 
different spatial resolutions, ensuring a better representation of the E-P field to be obtained. 
Table 1 shows a comparison of TROVA with other software available to the scientific community: 
WaterSip (Fremme and Sodemann, 2019) and HAMSTER (Keune et al., 2022), in which the main 
differences/advantages can be observed. For more details, consult the article: Fernández-Alvarez et al. (2022).

TROVA software validation
----------------------------------------

TROVA software has been widely validated in the analysis of moisture sources originating from tropical 
(Pérez-Alarcón et al., 2022a,b) and extratropical cyclones (Coll-Hidalgo et al., 2024a,b) and Atmospheric Rivers 
(Fernández‐Alvarez et al., 2022; Eiras‐Barca et al., 2025) and Low-level jets (Eiras‐Barca et al., 2025) for the 
North Atlantic basin using Lagrangian methodologies such as Sthol and James (2005) and Sodemann et al. (2008).
In these studies, outputs from FLEXPART or FLEXPART-WRF forced with ERA-Interim, ERA5, and climate scenarios (CMIP6 data) 
were used. In addition, it was evaluated using the methodology of Stohl and James (2005) for climatological studies of 
moisture sources contributing to the Iberian Peninsula and for moisture sinks associated with the sources in the North 
Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. These results can be consulted in Fernandez-Alvarez et al. (2023). 
Currently, it is being used in many research studies that are under review.

TROVA impact
----------------------------------------

The moisture transport from ocean sources to the continents forms the link between evaporation from the ocean
and precipitation over the continents, thus establishing the moisture source-sink relationship. In the 
context of climate change, a change in moisture transport is associated with the moisture increase derived 
from the increment of temperature. Therefore, the study of moisture transport is crucial for a better
understanding of the observed changes and those derived from projections of future climate data. 
Therefore, it is important to have a set of tools for Lagrangian post-processing of different model outputs.
Specifically, TROVA enables the user community to post-process these model outputs in present and future times 
to understand changes in the hydrological cycle. In addition, TROVA allows for the two main Lagrangian methodologies 
established in literature to be integrated into a single tool, thus facilitating comparison of the results obtained 
and proposing more conclusive results for the scientific community.
